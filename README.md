## Skynet Requirements
- App should utilize MySky and Content Record DAC, which allow users to submit activities to their leaderboard
- MySky: lets a user track and access data across any Skynet App with a single login (universal login)
- DACs: data access controller; allow developers to build on shared resources using exposed APIs, w/o worrying that another app's code might ruin your data
- app lives on skynet with skynet URL
- app should engage users to create content that can then be interacted with by other users (this is the theme)
- app is submitted to skynet app store
